Updates are checked approximately every 5 minutes and automatically pushed via GitHub Actions.  
API outputs are stored in the [`output`](/output/) directory.

## Contents of the Archive

The following APIs are currently being monitored:

- Launcher
  - Get latest game (Global, China)
  - Get latest game resources (Global, China)
  - Get latest launcher (Global, China)
  - Get launcher web resources (Global, China)
    - Announcements

Most raw data is provided "as-is" without modification. Some files (e.g., `index_*.json`) have been decrypted for readability.

The following binary data is archived in an external repository:

- Game packages (.zip)
- Game patch packages (.zip)
- Game hotfix resources
  - To avoid the overhead of managing numerous small files, these are bundled into larger chunk files.
- Launcher packages (.exe, .zip)

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with the `v1.2.4` game update, the `v2` (HDiff+incremental) method has been adopted for game package patch updates. For details, please see [MEMO.md](MEMO.md).  
> Update patches using the legacy `v1` (incremental) method are also available (likely for use with slow storage devices such as HDDs), but they have been excluded from the archive for efficiency.

For a full list of externally archived files, please refer to the mirror list JSON in the `output` directory. (Note: `*_pending` files are temporary files used during the archiving process.)

For users in Asia (including China, Japan, Korea): To speed up downloads, use any GitHub proxy service (such as [`gh-proxy.org`](https://gh-proxy.org/), which is cached by Cloudflare).

## Contributing

As I can only test the game on the platforms and operating systems available to me, some data may contain inaccuracies. If you have information—particularly regarding **Chinese regional data** or beta versions—or if you would like to improve the code, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.
